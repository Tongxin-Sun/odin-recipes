    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This butter cookie recipe is perfect for beginners. The cookies are crispy, fragrant, and can be shaped into any design you like!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g Butter</li>
        <li>290g Cake flour</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>60g Powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces and let it soften at room temperature until it's soft enough to make an indentation with your finger.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter (for about 40 seconds) using the low-speed setting on your mixer.</li>
        <li>Sift in the powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix with the mixer until well combined (about 30 seconds).</li>
        <li>Gradually add the beaten egg in two portions, mixing well each time with the mixer.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture into a smooth dough, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Roll out the chilled dough to the desired thickness, referencing the thickness of your cookie cutter.</li>
        <li>Start cutting from the edges: first cut the borders, then press the inner patterns.</li>
        <li>When removing the dough from the molds, take out the pattern pieces first, followed by the border pieces.</li>
        <li>After cutting out the entire sheet of dough, gather the remaining scraps, knead them into a dough again, roll out, and continue making cookies until the dough is used up.</li>
        <li>Bake at 150°C (302°F) using both the upper and lower heating elements for 20 minutes. (Adjust the time and temperature according to your oven's characteristics if necessary.)</li>
    </ol>
